The use of robots is expected to become part of our everyday life's.
There are is quite a market for little house cleaning robots or
toys. Most of these robots rely on being
taught and programmed by a skilled human operator.
This means robots still have problems to automatically acquire
new skills and changing environments and requirements.
Recent research is focusing on Reinforcement Learning as a framework
to solve the robot control problem.

Policy search methods, a sub-field of reinforcement learning, try to
optimize the robot's policy parameters for the task at hand.

In this thesis we try to improve the sample efficiency of a policy search algorithm,
which is of special importance for robotics. This is done
by using classical recursive estimation techniques like the Kalman filter.

We implement different versions of Filtering algorithms and compare them with
previous methods and benchmark them on optimization test function and simple
planar robot tasks.
