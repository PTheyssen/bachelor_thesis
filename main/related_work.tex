\section{Policy Search Algorithms}
- episodic REPS --> use of KL-divergence

- in MORE algorithm we use surrogate model to
calculate KL-divergence bound, opposed to a Taylor approximations
or sample based approximation of the KL-bound

- natural gradient by NES (update direction of parameters like standard
gradient but still in bound by KL-divergence)


- CMA-ES is state of the art in stochastic search optimization and the sample
  efficiency of it


\section{Parameter Estimation}

- look for some examples of kalman filter used for parameter estimation
